# JCRON: The Next-Generation Cron Expression Scheduler

**A comprehensive guide to JCRON - the advanced cron scheduler that extends traditional cron syntax with powerful enterprise features**

---

## Introduction

In the world of task scheduling, cron expressions have been the de facto standard for decades. However, as applications have grown more sophisticated, the limitations of traditional cron syntax have become increasingly apparent. Enter **JCRON** - a modern, extended cron expression language that maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful features for complex scheduling scenarios.

JCRON is available in three production-ready implementations:
- **PostgreSQL/SQL** - Native database scheduling with 10,000+ patterns/sec throughput
- **Node.js/TypeScript** - Server-side JavaScript scheduling with full async support
- **Go** - High-performance scheduling with goroutine-safe operations

All three implementations share the same syntax and feature set, ensuring consistency across your technology stack.

## Why JCRON?

### Traditional Cron Limitations

Standard cron expressions suffer from several limitations:
- No support for "last day of month" scheduling
- Cannot express "nth weekday of month" (e.g., "second Tuesday")
- No ISO 8601 week-of-year filtering
- Timezone handling is external to the expression
- No built-in end-of-period or start-of-period modifiers

### JCRON Enhancements

JCRON addresses these limitations while maintaining full backward compatibility:
- **Special Syntax**: L (last), # (nth), W (weekday) operators
- **Week of Year (WOY)**: ISO 8601 week-based scheduling
- **Timezone Support**: Built-in timezone specification
- **Period Modifiers**: End-of-day, start-of-week, etc.
- **Sub-second Precision**: Full support for seconds field
- **High Performance**: Optimized for production workloads (10K+ ops/sec)

---

## Core Syntax

### Standard 6-Field Format

JCRON uses a 6-field cron expression format:

```
second minute hour day month day-of-week
```

Each field can contain:
- **Asterisk (*)**: Any value
- **Number**: Specific value
- **Range (-)**: Range of values (e.g., 1-5)
- **List (,)**: Multiple values (e.g., 1,15,30)
- **Step (/\*)**: Step values (e.g., */5 for every 5 units)

### Field Value Ranges

| Field | Range | Special Values |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Second | 0-59 | */5, */10, */15, */30 |
| Minute | 0-59 | */5, */10, */15, */30 |
| Hour | 0-23 | */2, */3, */4, */6, */12 |
| Day | 1-31 | L (last), W (weekday), 1-31 |
| Month | 1-12 | */3, */6 (quarterly, semi-annual) |
| Day of Week | 0-6 | L (last), # (nth), 0=Sunday |

## Basic Scheduling Patterns

### Time-Based Schedules

**Every Minute:**
- `0 * * * * *` - Every minute on the minute
- `30 * * * * *` - Every minute at 30 seconds past

**Hourly Schedules:**
- `0 0 * * * *` - Top of every hour
- `0 15 * * * *` - 15 minutes past every hour
- `0 0 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours
- `0 0 */6 * * *` - Every 6 hours (4 times daily)

**Daily Schedules:**
- `0 0 0 * * *` - Midnight every day
- `0 0 9 * * *` - 9 AM daily
- `0 0 12 * * *` - Noon daily
- `0 30 14 * * *` - 2:30 PM daily

**Interval Schedules:**
- `0 */5 * * * *` - Every 5 minutes
- `0 */15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
- `0 */30 * * * *` - Every 30 minutes
- `0 0 */3 * * *` - Every 3 hours

### Day-Based Schedules

**Weekday Patterns:**
- `0 0 9 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 9 AM (Monday-Friday)
- `0 0 17 * * 1-5` - Weekdays at 5 PM
- `0 0 10 * * 0,6` - Weekends at 10 AM (Saturday-Sunday)
- `0 0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9 AM
- `0 0 17 * * 5` - Every Friday at 5 PM

**Specific Days:**
- `0 0 9 * * 2,4` - Tuesday and Thursday at 9 AM
- `0 0 12 * * 1,3,5` - Monday, Wednesday, Friday at noon
- `0 0 0 15 * *` - 15th of every month at midnight
- `0 0 0 1 * *` - First day of every month

**Monthly Patterns:**
- `0 0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` - First day of each quarter
- `0 0 0 1 */3 *` - First day every 3 months
- `0 0 0 1 1,7 *` - January 1st and July 1st (semi-annual)

---

## Advanced Special Syntax

### The L (Last) Operator

The L operator represents "last" and has powerful applications:

**Last Day of Month:**
- `0 0 0 L * *` - Last day of every month at midnight
- `0 0 23 L * *` - Last day of month at 11 PM
- `0 0 9 L * *` - Last day of month at 9 AM

**Last Weekday of Month:**
- `0 0 17 * * 5L` - Last Friday of month at 5 PM
- `0 0 9 * * 1L` - Last Monday of month at 9 AM
- `0 0 12 * * 3L` - Last Wednesday of month at noon

This is particularly useful for:
- Month-end financial reports
- Last-Friday deployment windows
- End-of-month batch processing
- Payroll on last working day

### The # (Nth) Operator

The # operator specifies the nth occurrence of a weekday:

**Nth Weekday of Month:**
- `0 0 9 * * 1#1` - First Monday at 9 AM
- `0 0 9 * * 1#2` - Second Monday at 9 AM
- `0 0 9 * * 2#3` - Third Tuesday at 9 AM
- `0 0 14 * * 5#2` - Second Friday at 2 PM

Common use cases:
- "First Monday" board meetings
- "Second Tuesday" patch updates
- "Third Thursday" training sessions
- "Fourth Friday" team events

### The W (Weekday) Operator

The W operator adjusts to the nearest weekday:

**Nearest Weekday:**
- `0 0 0 15W * *` - Nearest weekday to 15th
- `0 0 0 1W * *` - Nearest weekday to 1st
- `0 0 0 LW * *` - Last weekday of month

Perfect for:
- Payroll (must be weekday)
- Business-day-only operations
- Avoiding weekend deployments

---

## Week of Year (WOY) Scheduling

One of JCRON's most powerful features is ISO 8601 week-based scheduling:

### WOY Syntax

Format: `pattern WOY:week-spec`

**Examples:**
- `0 0 0 * * * WOY:1` - Week 1 of year (early January)
- `0 0 0 * * * WOY:1,2,3` - First 3 weeks of year
- `0 0 0 * * * WOY:10,20,30` - Weeks 10, 20, 30
- `0 0 0 * * * WOY:52,53` - Last weeks of year
- `0 0 0 * * * WOY:1,13,26,39,52` - Quarterly weeks

### WOY Use Cases

**Annual Planning:**
- Sprint planning in specific weeks
- Quarterly review weeks
- Year-end closing procedures

**Seasonal Operations:**
- Summer maintenance (weeks 22-35)
- Holiday preparation (weeks 48-52)
- Tax season processing (weeks 1-16)

**Compliance & Reporting:**
- Weekly compliance checks in audit weeks
- Monthly reporting in specific weeks
- Quarterly board meeting weeks

**Project Management:**
- Two-week sprint cycles (WOY:1,3,5,7...)
- Monthly milestone reviews

---

## Timezone Support

JCRON includes built-in timezone support, eliminating external timezone conversion:

### Timezone Syntax

Format: `TZ:timezone pattern`

**Examples:**
- `TZ:America/New_York 0 0 9 * * 1-5` - New York business hours
- `TZ:Europe/London 0 0 0 * * *` - London midnight
- `TZ:Asia/Tokyo 0 0 17 * * 5` - Tokyo Friday 5 PM
- `TZ:UTC 0 0 0 1 * *` - UTC first of month

### Global Operations

**Multi-Region Scheduling:**
- US East Coast office hours: `TZ:America/New_York 0 0 9-17 * * 1-5`
- European office hours: `TZ:Europe/Paris 0 0 9-17 * * 1-5`
- Asia-Pacific business hours: `TZ:Asia/Singapore 0 0 9-17 * * 1-5`

**Follow-the-Sun Support:**
Different patterns for different regions ensure 24/7 coverage while respecting local business hours.

**Compliance:**
Execute reports at specific times in regulatory timezones (e.g., UTC for financial markets, local time for GDPR).

## Period Modifiers (EOD/SOD)

JCRON supports end-of-period and start-of-period modifiers:

### Modifier Syntax

**End of Period (E):**
- `E1D` - End of day (23:59:59.999)
- `E1W` - End of week (Sunday 23:59:59.999)
- `E1M` - End of month (last day 23:59:59.999)

**Start of Period (S):**
- `S1D` - Start of day (00:00:00.000)
- `S1W` - Start of week (Monday 00:00:00.000)
- `S1M` - Start of month (1st day 00:00:00.000)

### Combined Examples

**With Cron Patterns:**
- `0 0 0 * * * E1D` - Daily at end of day
- `0 0 9 * * 1 S1W` - Monday 9 AM (start of week)
- `0 0 0 L * * E1M` - Last moment of last day of month
- `0 0 0 1 * * S1M` - First moment of first day of month

### Use Cases

**Cutoff Times:**
- End-of-day batch processing
- Daily cutoff for order processing
- Month-end financial close

**Reporting:**
- Start-of-week reports

## Migration from Traditional Cron

### Backward Compatibility

JCRON is fully backward compatible with standard 5-field cron. Simply add a seconds field:

**Standard Cron → JCRON:**
- `0 9 * * *` → `0 0 9 * * *` (add seconds)
- `*/15 * * * *` → `0 */15 * * * *` (add seconds)
- `0 0 1 * *` → `0 0 0 1 * *` (add seconds)

### Gradual Adoption

1. **Phase 1**: Add seconds field to existing patterns
2. **Phase 2**: Introduce timezone support where needed
3. **Phase 3**: Leverage special syntax (L, #, W)
4. **Phase 4**: Adopt WOY and period modifiers

### Testing
