## Key Optimizations Applied

### 1. Intelligent Fast Path Detection
- Common patterns detected automatically
- Direct calculation for frequent expressions
- No separate "fast" vs "standard" functions needed

### 2. Built-in Optimization Strategies
```sql
-- Examples of auto-optimized patterns:
'0 * * * *'        -- Every hour: Direct calculation
'*/15 * * * *'     -- Every 15 min: Mathematical optimization  
'0 9 * * 1-5'      -- Business hours: Logic optimization
'*/5 * * * *'      -- Every 5 min: Interval optimization
'0 0 * * *'        -- Daily: Date truncation
```
