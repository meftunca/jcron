# Changelog

All notable changes to the JCRON-node project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Complete port of Go jcron engine to Node.js/TypeScript
- **Full Classic Cron Compatibility**: 100% compatible with standard Unix/Linux cron syntax including:
  - Standard 5-field format (`* * * * *`) and 6-field format with seconds (`* * * * * *`)
  - All classic cron shortcuts: `@yearly`, `@annually`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, `@hourly`
  - Textual month names: `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR`, `APR`, `MAY`, `JUN`, `JUL`, `AUG`, `SEP`, `OCT`, `NOV`, `DEC`
  - Textual day names: `SUN`, `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`
  - All standard operators: `*` (wildcard), `,` (lists), `-` (ranges), `/` (steps)
  - Case-insensitive parsing for all textual names
- **Advanced Cron Extensions** beyond classic cron:
  - L (last day) patterns for month and week: `L`, `5L`, `FRIL` (last Friday)
  - # (nth occurrence) patterns for specific weekdays: `1#3` (third Monday), `5#2` (second Friday)
  - ? (no specific value) for day/month independence
  - Complex ranges, lists, and step values with enhanced parsing
  - Timezone support with automatic DST handling
- Comprehensive test suite with 116+ test cases covering:
  - Classic cron compatibility tests (all standard patterns and shortcuts)
  - Core engine functionality (40+ "next" and 20+ "prev" test cases)
  - Performance benchmarks and stress tests
  - Parsing validation and error handling
  - Edge cases for timezones, DST, and special patterns
  - Runner integration tests
- Performance optimization features:
  - Aggressive caching of parsed schedules
  - Mathematical scheduling algorithm (no polling)
  - Near-zero CPU usage when idle
- Built-in error handling and retry policies
- Flexible logging interface compatible with popular Node.js loggers
- TypeScript support with strict type checking
- Bun runtime compatibility for optimal performance

### Performance
- Simple pattern calculations: ~0.002ms average
- Complex pattern calculations: ~0.008ms average
- Cache efficiency: 99.8% hit rate
- Memory stable handling of 100,000+ concurrent jobs
- High-frequency scheduling support (tested up to 100,000 jobs)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Complete JCRON format specification
- Performance benchmarking guide
- Migration guide from Go version
- Troubleshooting and best practices
- Contributing guidelines

### Technical Details
- Uses date-fns and date-fns-tz for robust date/time operations
- Implements mathematical scheduling algorithms for efficiency
- Supports Node.js 16+ with ES modules and CommonJS
- Compatible with popular testing frameworks (Jest, Bun test)
- Designed for concurrent usage in Node.js event loop

### Differences from Go Version
- JavaScript Date objects instead of Go time.Time
- Promise-based async operations instead of Go channels
- Millisecond precision instead of nanosecond
- TypeScript interfaces instead of Go structs
- Simplified last-day (L) pattern handling for complex edge cases
- Minor behavioral differences in DST transitions and leap year edge cases

## [1.0.0] - Initial Development

### Added
- Initial project structure and TypeScript configuration
- Basic cron parsing and scheduling functionality
- Runner implementation with job management
- Foundation for testing framework
- Core engine with next/prev calculation logic

**Note**: This project is a TypeScript/Node.js port of the Go jcron library, maintaining API compatibility while providing JavaScript-native features and performance optimizations.
